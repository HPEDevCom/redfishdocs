            * `HighSecurity`: Manager is operating in high security mode, requiring extra authentication on host interface(s), and stronger encryption on network interfaces.

            * `FIPS`: Similar to High Security. This mode is intended to meet the FIPS 140-2 level 1 and Common Criteria security requirements. A reset to defaults is required to exit this mode.

            * `CNSA`: Same as FIPS. Additionally meets the criteria for NSA Commercial National Security Algorithm suite.  Must be in FIPS mode to transition to CNSA.

            * `SuiteB`: Same as FIPS. Additionally meets the criteria for NSA SuiteB Top Secret installations.  Must be in FIPS mode to transition to SuiteB.

              * `Unconfigured`: The logical drive is not configured

              * `Recovering`: The logical drive is using Interim Recovery Mode. In Interim Recovery Mode, at least one physical drive has failed, but the logical drive''s fault tolerance mode lets the drive continue to operate with no data loss

              * `ReadyForRebuild`: The logical drive is ready for Automatic Data Recovery. A failed physical drive has been replaced, but the logical drive is still operating in Interim Recovery Mode

              * `Rebuilding`: The logical drive is currently doing Automatic Data Recovery, where fault tolerance algorithms restore data to the replacement drive

              * `WrongDrive`: The wrong physical drive was replaced after a failure

              * `BadConnect`: A physical drive is not responding

              * `Overheating`: The drive array enclosure that contains the logical drive is overheating. The drive array is still functional, but should be shutdown

              * `Shutdown`: The drive array enclosure that contains the logical drive has overheated. The logical drive is no longer functional

              * `Expanding`: The logical drive is currently undergoing a transformation (expansion, shrinkage or movement). During transformation, fault tolerance algorithms redistribute logical drive data according to the transformation operation selected

              * `NotAvailable`: The logical drive is currently unavailable. If a logical drive is expanding and the new configuration frees additional disk space, this free space can be configured into another logical volume. If this is done, the new volume will be set to not available

              * `QueuedForExpansion`: The logical drive is ready for transformation (expansion, shrinkage or movement). The logical drive is in the queue for transformation

              * `MultipathAccessDegraded`: Previously all disk drives of this logical drive had more than one I/O path to the controller, but now one or few of them have only one I/O path

              * `Erasing`: The logical drive is currently being erased

              * `PredictiveSpareRebuildReady`: The logical drive is ready to perform a predictive spare rebuild. The logical drive is in the queue for rebuild

              * `RapidParityInitInProgress`: The logical drive is currently undergoing rapid parity initialization (RPI). The logical drive is unavailable to the operating system during RPI and will be made available once RPI has completed

              * `RapidParityInitPending`: The logical drive is currently pending RPI and will be unavailable

              * `NoAccessEncryptedNoControllerKey`: The logical drive is currently encrypted and cannot be accessed because the array controller has not yet received the encryption key nor was it found in the controller''s CSP NVRAM

              * `UnencryptedToEncryptedInProgress`:  The logical drive is currently being transformed from unencrypted to encrypted and the volume is online. Data will be written unencrypted if the write is directed to an LBA range on th e logical drive that has not yet been migrated

              * `NewKeyRekeyInProgress`: The logical drive is currently encrypted and all data is currently being rekeyed with a new logical drive key using the background capacity expansion transformation task. The logical drive is online

              * `NoAccessEncryptedControllerEncryptionNotEnabled`: The logical drive is currently encrypted and cannot be accessed because the array controller does not have encryption enabled

              * `UnencryptedToEncryptedNotStarted`: The logical drive has received a request to transform from unencrypted to encrypted but this process has not yet started. The unencrypted logical drive is currently online

              * `NewLogDrvKeyRekeyRequestReceived`: The logical drive is encrypted and has received a request to rekey all data with a new logical drive encryption key. The logical drive is online

              * `Unsupproted`: The state of the logical drive is unsupported
