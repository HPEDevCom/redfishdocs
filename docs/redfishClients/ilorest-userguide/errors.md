# Error Codes

The error codes listed below are returned by the HPE iLOrest tool.
They are coming from the Redfish(r) service implemented in the iLO firmware.
The verbose (`-v`) flag provides verbose output of HTTP, CHIF
(CHannel InterFace) and iLO response messages.
The error codes listed below are related to the Redfish client
side errors or specifically translated from errors received
through iLO response messages.

:::info NOTE
The Channel Interface (CHIF) driver is an HPE proprietary driver
allowing in-band communication between applications and the Insight
Lights Out (iLO) within HPE iLO based servers. It is stored as a dynamic
loadable library file (`ilorest_chif.dll`) on Microsoft Windows and a
shared object (`ilorest_chif.so`) on Linux.
:::

:::success TIPS

- For troubleshooting purposes and errors and anomalies evaluation,
  use the included optional argument flag `-v` or `-vv` for verbose
  command console output and the `-d`/`--debug` flag to produce
  an `iLOrest.log` log file in the current directory.
  For further details, refer to the Global Options section.
- To solve a
  `Missing token required for operation. Please add the proper token`
  error, add the BIOS password when executing the commands.
