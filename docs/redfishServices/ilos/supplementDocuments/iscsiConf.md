## iSCSI Software Initiator Configuration

## Introduction

   The iSCSI Software Initiator allows you to configure an iSCSI target
    device to be used as a boot source. The BIOS current configuration
    object contains a link to a separate resource of type
    `HpeiSCSISoftwareInitiator`. The BIOS current configuration resource
    and the iSCSI Software Initiator current configuration resources are
    read-only. To change iSCSI settings, you need to follow another link
    to the Settings resource, which allows PUT and PATCH operations.

The iSCSI target configurations are represented in an `iSCSISources`
  property, that is an array of objects, each containing the settings
  for a single target. The size of the array represents the total number
  of iSCSI boot sources that can be configured at the same time. Many
  mutable properties exist, including `iSCSIAttemptInstance`, which can
  be set to a unique integer in the range [1, N], where N is the boot
  sources array size. By default, this instance number is 0 for all
  objects, indicating that the object should be ignored
  when configuring iSCSI.

Each object also contains two read-only propertiesâ€”`StructuredBootString`
  and `UEFIDevicePath`, which are only populated after the target has
  been successfully configured as a boot source. More information about
  each property is available in the corresponding schema. The iSCSI
  initiator name is represented by the `iSCSIInitiatorName` property.

An additional read-only property, `iSCSINicSources`, is only shown in
  the iSCSI current configuration resource. This property is an array of
  strings representing the possible NIC instances that can be used as
  targets for iSCSI boot configuration. To confirm which NIC device each
  string corresponds to, it is recommended to cross-reference two
  other resources.

* A resource of type `HpeBiosMapping` can be found through a `Mappings` link
  in the BIOS current configurations resource. Within its
  `BiosPciSettingsMappings` property is an array of mappings between
  BIOS-specific device strings (such as the `NIC` source string) and
  a `CorrelatableID` string that can be used to refer to the same
  device in non-BIOS contexts.
* A collection of `HpeServerPciDevices` may be found through a PCIDevices
  link in the `ComputerSystem` resource. To find the specific PCI device
  corresponding to the NIC instance, you can search for the `CorrelatableID`
  that usually matches a `UEFIDevicePath.` Once you find the
  `HpeServerPciDevice` resource, you have access to all the
  human-readable properties useful for describing a NIC source.

Changing the `iSCSISources` and `iSCSIInitiatorName` settings can be done
through `PATCH` operations, very similar to how `HpeBios` settings are
changed. However, whereas all BIOS settings are located in a single flat
object, iSCSI settings are nested into arrays and sub-objects. When doing
a `PATCH` operation, use empty objects (`{}`) in place of those boot
source objects that you do not want to alter.

The following example covers a situation where you have configured two
iSCSI boot sources, and you would like to edit some existing settings,
and add a third source.

1. Iterate through `/redfish/v1/Systems` and choose a member `ComputerSystem.`
    Find a child resource of type `HpeiSCSISoftwareInitiator` that allows
    PATCH operations.

    * `{ilo-address}/redfish/v1/Systems/1/BIOS/iSCSI/Settings`

2. Inspect the existing `iSCSISources` array. You need to inspect the
  `iSCSIAttemptInstance` property of each object to find the boot sources
  you are prefer to change.

3. Create a new JSON object with the `iSCSISources` property.

    * Use an empty object in the position of instance 1 to indicate that
      it should not be modified.
Use an object in the position of instance 2 containing the properties that
should be modified. All omitted properties remain unmodified.

    * To add a new boot source, find any position of instance 0 and replace
      it with an object containing all the new settings, and most
      importantly, a new unique value of `iSCSIAttemptInstance.`

4. Change the iSCSI software initiator settings.

    * `PATCH {ilo-address}/redfish/v1/Systems/1/BIOS/iSCSI/Settings`
