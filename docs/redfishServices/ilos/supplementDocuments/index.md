## RedfishÂ® supplement documents

This supplement documents section provides useful technical
information with practical examples that should work against
the different versions of iLO firmware. As an example, the
[OData query options](/docs/redfishservices/ilos/supplementdocuments/odataqueryoptions/)
page explains briefly the concept of OData query
options and provides examples that can be used to
simplify Redfish client requests and associated response parsing.

:::info INFO
Supplement documents are regularly updated.
You should check the last update date in the upper
left corner of the main pane of each document.

## Supplement documents organization

The supplement documents menu (left pane)
contains two types of entries:

- Sub-menu entries
  (i.e.
  [Security](/docs/redfishservices/ilos/supplementdocuments/securityservice/))
  in which several documents are grouped together, all referring to a
  single theme.
- Plain entries
  (ex:
  [Log services](/docs/redfishservices/ilos/supplementdocuments/logservices/),
  [Storage data models](/docs/redfishservices/ilos/supplementdocuments/storage/)
  , etc.).
