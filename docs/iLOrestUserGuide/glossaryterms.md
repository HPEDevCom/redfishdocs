|    Puppet                      |  Puppet is an automation tool that lets you customize the deployment of software according to the configuration of the servers. Puppet works differently from Ansible and Chef in that a Puppet agent is installed on the nodes. The Puppet agent periodically contacts the centralized Puppet master to determine if its node has the latest configuration. The Puppet master can require different configurations across the nodes. Puppet has two versions: open source and Puppet Enterprise.  |
