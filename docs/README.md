# Documents folder

The `docs` folder contains an `index.md` file describing the `Home` page of the Portal (Splash HPE banner and `Start Here` button). Subfolders contain an `index.md` files describing each section of the Portal as well as the related markdown files:

* The [concepts](./concepts) directory contains generic Redfish concepts like authentication, Redfish conformance, navigating the data model...
* The [examples](./examples) directory contains sets of example use cases like Bios, ISCSI or boot examples.
* The [ilos](./ilos) directory contains one subfolder per iLO generation starting at iLO 6.
* [\_ilorest-userguide](./\_ilorest-userguide) is a place holder for the iLOrest Redfish client. Remove the `_` leading char before moving files in this folder.
* The [\_scripts](./_scripts) folder contains scripts to port autogenerated files from the Slate MD to Redocly MD. Launch the [wrapper](./\_scripts/\_script_wrapper.sh) for each new version of those files, and before rendering the portal.

## iLO Redfish API

### File mapping between iLO 5 and iLO 6

In order to ease the migration from the Slate infra to Redocly, the following table lists the mapping between the iLO 5 Slate and iLO 6 Redocly markdown files. It contains as well an "MD Port", "Content review" and "Comments"columns.

The "Port" column contain info whether the file has been ported to Redocly markdown. The values in that column can be "Done", "Partially done" or "To be done". See the [Guidelines to convert from Slate](../README.md/#guidelines-to-convert-from-slate) paragraph in the main README.md for more detail.

The "Content review" column contains info whether the content of the file has been reviewed, in terms of technical accuracy. The possible values are identical to the "MD Port" values.

The "Comment" column may contain any other interesting comments.

**NOTE**: As a good practice, the content of this file should be updated during the entire Redocly project.

| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| \_ilo5\_accountservice.md | docs/redfishServices/ilos/supplementDocuments/accountservice.md | Partially Done | To be done | Import of Certificate CA example should be tested/reviewed carefully. Need to fix several typos.|

If supported, need to include an example. May be need more complex examples ? Or specify which complex queries are not supported. |
| \_ilo5\_authentication.md | docs/concepts/redfishAuthentication.md | Done | To be done | Need a careful review of the content. It would be good to add a paragraph (or an example) for certificate authentication. |
| \_ilo5\_backupandrestore.md | docs/redfishServices/ilos/supplementDocuments/backupAndRestore.md | Done | Partially done | Need to be reviewed. Need to better document the backup operation (how to create a backup file: just perform a GET) and the restore operation (HttpPushUri workload). |
| \_ilo5\_bestpractice.md | docs/concepts/client\_bestpractices.md | Done | To be done | The content of this file must be completely reconsidered. A removal might be considered. This file has been created before Redfish v1.6. Since then, it is Ok to assume [non collection] URIs.

| \_ilo5\_events.md | docs/concepts/redfishEvents | Done | To be done | Need a careful content review. The example should contain a `RegistryPrefixes` list and a mean to find the list of valid items (i.e. NetworkDevice). It should mention as well that `EventTypes` is not supported because deprecated. Need to add a Response Body and status in the example. |

### Scripts for autogenerated files

As mentioned in the main [README.md](../README.md) file, and until the automatic `tools/make.ps1` and associated Python scripts are able to generate Redocly markdown files (`resmap.md`, `resourcedefns.md`, `msgregs.md` and `events.md`), it is necessary to use the scripts in the `docs/_scripts` folder before rendering newly imported versions of these files.

#### Scripts description

* The `_script_wrapper.sh` script defines variables and calls the other scripts in the following sequence `_split_resourcedefns.sh`, `_resourcedefns.sh`, `_resmap.sh` and then `events.md`.

* The `_split_resourcedefns.sh` splits the original `_resourcedefns.md` file in several smaller files. This is needed because, at the time of the writing, Redocly cannot handle md files with more than sixteen or seventeen thousands lines. The rendering process (local or remote) fails with a `Maximum stack size exceeded`.

* The `_resourcedefns.sh` script adapts the different `ilo6_.*_resourcedefns.md` files to the Redocly MD format. In addition, it fixes fragments of _Links to other Resources_ tables.

* The `_resmap.sh` script adapts the `ilo6_resmap.md` file to the Redocly MD format. Moreover, compared to iLO 5, URIs labeled _Collection of_ point to the collection URI, and not to the members URI. As an example, in iLO 5, the _Collection of Chassis_ points to `(#Chassis)`. Redocly's  iLO 6 `resmap.md` , points to `(#ChassisCollection).

#### Methodology to import autogenerated files

Once the autogenerated files for iLO 6 version `X.YZ` have been generated by the `tools/make.ps1` script and, optionally reviewed and fixed, copy them as the following:

| original file name | target file location |
| --- | --- |
| `_ilo6_resourcedefns.md` | .../_ilo6_XYZ/_raw_ilo6_resourcedefnsXYZ.md-bck |
| `_ilo6_resmap.md` | .../ilo6/ilo6_XYZ/_raw_ilo6_resmapXYZ.md-bck |
| `_ilo6_msgregs.md` | .../ilo6/ilo6_XYZ/_raw_ilo6_msgregs.md-bck |
| `_tbd_events.md` | .../ilo6/ilo6_XYZ/_raw_ilo6_eventsXYZ.md-bck |

Then, launch the `_script_wrapper.sh` script, that will last between and 15 and 20 minutes on a laptop.

### Dispatched examples or paragraphs

In order to have a more coherent location of examples (generic or iLO specific) and technical info (i.e. `iLO 6 Data Model Changes`), the content of some Slate files has been dispatched in other Redocly files.
