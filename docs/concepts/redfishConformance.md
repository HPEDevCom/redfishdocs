# Redfish Conformance

<!-- Need to introduce basic concepts of Redfish conformance with explicit references to DMTF documents 

     It would be good to specify to which versions of Redfish DSPs (DSP0266 AND DSP0268) the iLO 6 version 
     is conformant to. 

     Concerning the data model, notice that iLO 6 1.10's  `/redfish/v1/LicenseService` is an HPE OEM extension data type
     (HpeLicenseCollection). Does this means that iLO 6 cannot be compliant to DSP0268 2021.4 ? If not, we need to explain why.

A general Redfish conformance introduction is available in the <a href="https://developer.hpe.com/blog/getting-started-with-ilo-restful-api-redfish-api-conformance/" target="_blank"> Getting started with iLO RESTful API - RedfishÂ® API Conformance </a> article.
