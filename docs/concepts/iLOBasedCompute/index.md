# Redfish implementation in HPE iLO based compute nodes

This is a placeholder for any interesting info concerning the Redfish implementation in HPE iLO based servers. Something like:

To manage efficiently HPE iLO based compute nodes, use Redfish instead of using intermediate tools such as HPEâ€™s HPQLOCFG or CONREP.

# Redfish conformance

## iLO 4

TBD

## iLO 5
